This paper formally develops these concepts in a way that generalizes the construction
of Figure 1 to allow arbitrary graphical models inside the plate, and a more general observation
model that includes both noisy observations and observations involving multiple variables. We develop
an efficient Gibbs sampler to conduct inference in CGMs that builds on existing work for conducting
exact tests in contingency tables and makes several novel technical contributions. Foremost
is the analysis of the distribution over the move size , which we show to be a discrete univariate
distribution that generalizes both the binomial and hypergeometric distributions. In particular, we
prove that it is always log-concave [3], so it can be sampled in constant expected running time.
